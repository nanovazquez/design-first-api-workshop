# Design-first APIs workshop

This workshop's goal is to introduce how to design APIs using OAS/Swagger and what you could get from its ecosystem/tooling with no/little implementation. It consists of different exercises, each one of them focuses in each stage of the lifecycle of an API: from design, testing, and consumption to the real implementation.

The primary goal is to show you all the benefits you could get since day one without writing a single line of code in your API. And compare what we are going to do with the usual code-first approach.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have installed:

- [Node 8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) or higher installed in your laptop.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or similar.
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or similar.
- [Optional] A [Now account](https://zeit.co/now) and the [Now Cli](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) globally installed (or similar, like Heroku)

## Exercises

We divided the workshop in these exercises. You don't need to complete any previous exercises to start a new one: each one of them has everything you need to start from scratch inside the **begin** folder, and the result we expect you to achieve inside the **end** folder. You can either use what you built in the previous exercise or use the contents of the begin folder.

- [Exercise 1: Writing your first OAS Document](./exercises/exercise-1/README.md)
- [Exercise 2: Using the autogenerated Client SDK to develop a user interface](./exercises/exercise-2/README.md)
- [Exercise 3: Creating a real service that implements your OAS document](./exercises/exercise-3/README.md)
